    # This strategy section allows you to test your project with multiple versions of a language.
    # Adjust this section based on your project's language (e.g., Python versions, Java versions).
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x, 20.x] # Example for Node.js: Tests with Node.js 18 and 20.

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Action to fetch your repository's code

      - name: Setup environment (${{ matrix.node-version }})
        # Replace 'actions/setup-node@v4' with the appropriate setup action for your language:
        # For Python: uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        # For Java:   uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        # For Go:     uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          # Caching dependencies can speed up workflow runs. Adjust 'npm' based on your package manager.
          cache: 'npm' # Use 'yarn', 'pnpm' for Node.js, or omit for other languages (e.g., Python often caches via pip)

      - name: Install dependencies
        # This command installs your project's dependencies.
        # Examples:
        # - Node.js: npm ci (recommended), yarn install --frozen-lockfile, pnpm install
        # - Python: pip install -r requirements.txt
        # - Java (Maven): mvn clean install -DskipTests
        # - Ruby: bundle install
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        # This command executes your project's tests.
        # Examples:
        # - Node.js: npm test, jest
        # - Python: pytest, python -m unittest discover
        # - Java: mvn test, gradle test
        # - Go: go test ./...
        run: npm test

      # - name: Build project (optional)
      #   # Uncomment and adjust this step if your project requires a build process (e.g., compiling code, bundling assets).
      #   # Examples:
      #   # - Node.js: npm run build, webpack
      #   # - Java: mvn package, gradle build
      #   # - Go: go build ./...
      #   run: npm run build
